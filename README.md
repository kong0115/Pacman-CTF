# Pacman-CTF
AI Pacman Capture the Flag Project

Designed two Pacman agents in Python to compete against other groups in an AI course contest and won 2nd place out of 36 teams.
An offensive agent is implemented to steal the enemy pellets and bring them back alive to my base, 
and a defensive agent is implemented to protect the pellets on my territory being stolen by the enemy team.
Agents are designed based on my own powerful strategy, game information queried from the APIs, and adversarial search with heuristic evaluation.
